**<h1>Python (Django) coding assessment</h1>**

Create **a user registration page** in a website using Django.
- Users can sign in the web only after passing the email verification. (sendgrid is one of the choices)
- Users can change password and edit their profiles.
- The website should work within **intranet**, no dependency on public networking. Try to explain how you will build the site in detail.
